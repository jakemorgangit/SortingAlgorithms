# SortingAlgorithms
Visual representation of a few different sorting algorithms in JavaScript

Kind of inspired by this article  https://towardsdatascience.com/5-sorting-algorithms-in-python-c7ece9df5dd6 , I wanted to write my own in JS and play with a few more algorithms.

Still a bit buggy but works for the most part.  A page refresh can make the bugs go away for a bit.

Todo:
* Fix `bucketsort`
